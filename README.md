Auburn University Mobile Apps Assignment 05. This assignment tasks us with creating a currency conversion app. A user will input an integer into a text field. If the input is anything but an integer, an error will be thrown and printed to the screen. Once the user inputs a valid integer, they may select what types of currency they want to convert to. If the switch is ON and the convert button is pressed, a new view modal will display with the selected conversions displayed. The app will make use of structs and MVC style programming. It should look good in portrait or landscape mode, and on iPads.
